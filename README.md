# fairytemplate

This is a template for personal python library.   

## Memorandum 

This does not yet work.  

I'd like to incorporate configuration of [PEP621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/).    
After the above is installed, I'll do my best!  


## Usage

This repository uses [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).  


```
pip install cookicutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/sillte/fairytemplate
```
## Policy
* My environment is Windows 10, and only this environment is considered. 

* Setting files are described in `pyproject.toml` as much as possible.  
    - Since a personal repository seems to does not so much dependencies that the management of a single setting `toml` is difficult to handle.
